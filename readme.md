<h1 align="center">Genesis: Fake Data Generator</h1>

## What is it?
Fake Data Generator designed to send data to multiple destinations such as "Kafka Topics", "Web API" &amp; "Files".
More destinations will be added eventually if needed.

## Use Case
Ideal for generating fake data to test a endpoint.


## How does it work?
### Initialization
Before we start the project, we need to update the "defaults.config.ini" file that holds configurations. Then remane it to ".config.ini"

## How to use it?

```python
python generator.py
```
You can creat new templates in "genesis/templates"
